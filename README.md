# Kairos-Project 

Interview project for Kairos company


## Notes
* buttons inside .icon-view size depends on width of text, please tell me if you want me to give them a uniform size.
* styles required to match figma project are inside /styles/*.js files
* styles which can be adjusted by developer are inside /styles/*.css files
* to adjust width of left section of the landing page, use the inline style defined in .js in the App.jsx component
* if use sizes from figma project, it looks different than the figma project demo.  Adjusted sizes to match demo, => sizes are different to figma project but similar to figma demo
